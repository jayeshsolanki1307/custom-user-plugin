# custom-user-plugin
The Custom User Registration and Login Plugin provides seamless user registration with custom roles and metadata. It features a secure, shortcode-based login form that redirects logged-in users to a welcome page. Designed for ease of use and security, it sanitizes inputs and uses nonce verification to protect against CSRF attacks.
